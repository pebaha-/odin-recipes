        <img src="./flaeskesteg.jpg" alt="Delicious dish with pork roast, potatoes, red cabbage, and brown sauce">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Roast pork with crackling, caramelized potatoes, and red cabbage—this popular Danish dish is often eaten on
            Christmas Eve but also for many other festive occasions, including Sunday dinner. It consists of roast pork
            seasoned with a lot of salt. The secret of its success is the crackling: the rind is scored in narrow strips
            so that it puffs up and becomes crispy while it roasts.</p>
        <p>The pork roast is served with small boiled potatoes that have been caramelized in a mixture of butter and
            sugar, creating a golden brown mass in the pan. On the side goes pickled red cabbage, to cut through the
            sweetness, and, last but not least, a wonderful sauce of thickened pan juices.</p>
